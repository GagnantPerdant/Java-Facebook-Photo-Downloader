# Java-Facebook-Photo-Downloader
Login to your account with Java Facebook Photo Downloader and download all photo from any profile you can access.
It d/l photo using their original size/quality, and create directories for each album.
Doesn't use FB API, raw access is made.
Using multithread, super-fast.
Command-line, so it can be run on a server in crontab.

Idea for the future : add p2p so everybody can share photo... even photo unreachable from FB ! Add tags so you can search for particular photo.
